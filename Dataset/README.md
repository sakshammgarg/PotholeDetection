The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle.

Dataset: Pothole Detection Dataset

Link: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atulyakumar98/pothole-detection-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atulyakumar98/pothole-detection-dataset)

The dataset contains labeled images of road surfaces divided into two distinct categories: Potholes and Normal(Plain) roads.
It is designed to support the training and evaluation of hybrid deep learning models (Transformers & CNNs) for automated road damage assessment and infrastructure maintenance.
The objective is to accurately classify each input image into one of these two categories to assist in the early detection and repair of hazardous road conditions.
